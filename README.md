# armory
An app that helps you craft your own unique firearm, from a budget build to a gucci rifle.

Putting together a rifle or firearm can be a daunting task, especially with the near endless options and wide range of prices for both essential parts and optional accessories--armory makes that easier. 

Look through and compare lowers, uppers, grips, handguards, optics, barrels and more to see what best meets both your needs and your price point. Then put it all together to see how it looks. You can save your designs for later, edit them with the latest upgrades, or start over from a clean slate.
